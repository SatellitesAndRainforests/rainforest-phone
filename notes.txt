Best Motion/Presence Sensors for Camera Traps
Project 1: Raspberry Pi Night Vision Trap (Small Mammals & Insects)
For the Raspberry Pi-based trap, a 24 GHz FMCW mmWave radar sensor is the top choice. These sensors use high-frequency radio waves to detect motion and even stationary presence of objects. A prime example is the DFRobot 24 GHz Human Presence Radar (SEN0395), which can detect movement and stillness up to about 5–9 m away
dfrobot.com
. Such mmWave modules are highly resistant to false triggers – unlike PIR sensors, they aren’t affected by temperature shifts, ambient light, humidity, or dust
dfrobot.com
dfrobot.com
. This means Wi-Fi signals, rainforests heat, or swaying foliage are far less likely to cause phantom triggers. The sensor’s wide field of view (≈100° horizontal) covers a large area, reliably picking up a small mammal (like a squirrel) within a few meters. It can even sense subtle motion (e.g. breathing or slight movements) of a stationary animal once detected
dfrobot.com
. Key Features: The mmWave module outputs data via a simple UART (serial) interface and/or digital GPIO, making it easy to read from a Raspberry Pi (e.g. with Python serial libraries) or microcontroller. Community-supported libraries and examples are available (e.g. parsing presence/motion and distance on Arduino or Pi). These sensors are typically powered at 3.3–5 V and draw around 50–100 mA
dfrobot.com
, suitable for battery-powered operation. Physically they are quite compact (~24×28 mm board)
dfrobot.com
 and robust. You can mount the radar inside a waterproof housing (behind a plastic or acrylic window) since 24 GHz waves penetrate non-metal enclosures easily. Operating temperature range is wide (about –40 to 85 °C)
dfrobot.com
, fitting both tropical humidity and chilly UK nights. Importantly, mmWave’s anti-interference capability means minimal false positives – it “sensitively detect[s] both activity and stillness” while being “less susceptible to…temperature, ambient light, and environmental noise”
dfrobot.com
. In practice, this translates to reliable triggering only when a real creature is present, not when your Wi-Fi router chirps or the sun flashes through leaves. Recommended Product: HiLink HLK-LD2410 or equivalent 24 GHz radar modules (often re-branded by Seeed, DFRobot, etc.) meet these specs. For example, DFRobot’s SEN0395 (around £22–£25 each) is a plug-and-play unit in this class
dfrobot.com
. These support configurable sensitivity zones – you can tune the detection range and threshold so that even a small animal or large insect can trigger within a shorter radius, while ignoring far-off disturbances. The sensor provides presence/motion status and even an approximate distance reading over serial
community.element14.com
community.element14.com
, which could allow your Pi to know how far the subject is (helpful for focus or just filtering). Overall, a 24 GHz mmWave sensor offers scientific-grade reliability in the field: it works day or night, in rain or shine, with virtually no false alarms from environmental factors
dfrobot.com
. (Purchasing tip: search for “24 GHz mmWave presence sensor” – vendors include DFRobot, Seeed Studio, and others. The SEN0395 or HLK-LD2410 are proven options.)
Project 2: Android Smartphone Macro Trap (Insects at Close Range)
For the smartphone-based trap – which aims for high-detail macro photos of insects – the best solution is an infrared Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser range sensor, specifically the ST VL53L1X. This tiny module uses an eye-safe 940 nm laser to measure distances and will trigger when something (even as small as a few-millimeter insect) comes within its set range. Why ToF? It provides a narrow, precise detection beam – only objects directly in front of the sensor will register
adafruit.com
. This is ideal for a macro setup focused on, say, a particular flower or feeder: a bug landing in that zone will be detected, but background motion (wind-blown plants, other wildlife around) won’t trip the sensor. The VL53L1X can range from ~3 cm out to about 400 cm (4 m)
adafruit.com
, covering our needs (3–5 cm insect distance and up to ~2 m for larger creatures). It updates quickly (up to 50 Hz)
adafruit.com
, so fast-flying insects won’t be missed. Importantly, it works in complete darkness – the sensor emits its own IR light and measures the bounce-back time – making it suitable for night use as well. Precision & False Triggers: The ToF sensor’s field of view is only ~27°
adafruit.com
, essentially a narrow cone. This means it’s much more precise than a PIR or ultrasonic sensor – it will detect “only the surface directly in front of it”
adafruit.com
 rather than broad areas. As a result, false triggers are rare. It won’t get fooled by ambient light changes or heat, and it doesn’t respond to random RF noise. In fact, such laser-ranging sensors have been successfully used in traps for small cold-blooded animals and insects where PIR failed; for example, researchers built a reptile/insect camera trap using a VL53 series ToF sensor because PIRs couldn’t detect cold, small subjects
hackaday.com
. In our case, when an insect (a few millimeters in size) comes within ~5 cm of the sensor, the VL53L1X will detect a sudden distance change and can trigger the camera. If nothing is present, it will simply keep measuring the background (e.g. the far wall or infinity) and remain idle. This active sensing method avoids the “constantly on edge” noise issues of analog sensors – no triggers unless something actually enters the beam. Integration & Use: The VL53L1X connects via I²C and is supported by robust libraries in Python and Arduino C++
adafruit.com
. Many breakout boards (e.g. from Adafruit, Pololu, etc.) are available in the £12–£18 range
adafruit.com
, typically with level shifting and regulators to work with 3–5 V logic (so you can hook it to the Seeed XIAO microcontroller or directly to a Raspberry Pi’s I²C pins). Programming is straightforward – you initialize the sensor and continuously read distance; if the reading goes below a threshold (indicating something is very close), you trigger the phone’s camera (e.g. via the microcontroller over USB). The sensor is very small (a few millimeters chip on a 2 cm board) and can be embedded near the smartphone’s lens. For outdoor use, you’ll want to protect it with a clear window – a piece of IR-transparent acrylic or even glass works (the VL53L1X’s laser is invisible IR). Ensure no water can pool on the sensor; a small hood or recessed mounting helps keep rain off the lens. Given proper housing, the ToF sensor will operate in humid tropical conditions and daytime sun (it has internal filters to ignore ambient light, though extremely bright direct sunlight can reduce its max range modestly). Overall, the VL53L1X offers excellent reliability for insect-triggering – high sensitivity at close range and virtually zero false alarms from environmental factors or other wildlife. Its “laser barrier” like behavior makes it precisely target the subject area, which is crucial for scientific-grade macro photography.

Table: Comparison of sensor options for motion/presence detection. The 24 GHz mmWave and VL53L1X ToF are the recommended solutions, offering reliable detection across the required range of target sizes with minimal false triggers. Other options like high-frequency 60 GHz radars can be effective but come at a premium cost, while simple doppler radars (or PIRs) are economical but suffer significant false positives and limitations.
Conclusion and Practical Recommendations
For minimal false positives and robust performance in both tropical rainforest and UK environments, the 24 GHz mmWave radar sensor and the VL53L1X ToF sensor emerge as the best choices for the two camera trap projects. The mmWave module on the Raspberry Pi trap will give broad-range, all-weather motion/presence detection suitable for warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals alike (overcoming PIR’s weaknesses). Meanwhile, the laser ToF sensor on the smartphone trap will provide pinpoint-triggering for tiny insects in the camera’s focal zone, ensuring high-quality macro photos are only taken when the subject is present. Both sensors are within the budget (roughly £15–£25 each) and interface easily with Raspberry Pi (GPIO/Python) or microcontrollers like the Seeed XIAO (Arduino C++), with plenty of existing code examples
adafruit.com
. By leveraging these modern sensors – a mmWave radar for range and reliability and a ToF lidar for precision – you can build scientific-grade camera traps that operate day and night with very few false triggers. Each sensor should be housed appropriately (weatherproof casing, with the sensor’s “view” window kept clear) to ensure longevity in the field. With these choices, your camera traps will be highly sensitive to the intended wildlife (even a 5 mm insect at 5 cm or a squirrel at 5 m) yet stay quiet unless real motion is detected, exactly what’s needed for quality, research-grade imagery.
